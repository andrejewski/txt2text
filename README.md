txt2text
========

A Chrome extension that replaces a customizable list of acronyms with their expanded forms.

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/andrejewski/txt2text/blob/master/txt2text.crx?raw=true)

## Installation

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions. Drag txt2text.crx into the page that appears.
Open and refresh any page for the changes to reflect. 
(Refresh again if it does not work initially.)

## Customization

txt2text comes with plenty of common default translations (also known as "txt = text"). You control what text gets transformed. In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions. Then find the txt2text extension and select "Options," which will open your personal translation configuration file. For changes in this file to take effect on existing webpages, the webpages need to be reloaded.

Sample config:

```
lol = laugh out loud
k = okay
```

Note that heavy customization with hundreds of translations may begin to effect page load performance. This decreased performance will be especially apparent on large, text-rich webpages.

## Inspiration

This extension is simply [Cloud-to-Butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) but extended to use an arbirary list of translations. I cannot say I prefer all of the short-hand methods used in day-to-day internet life. Now I can read them the way I want.

## Fin

Thanks for using txt2text. Or for at least reading this far down into the README.
